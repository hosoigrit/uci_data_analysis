# uci_data_analysis

### objective
The target data are signals/variables collected from various measurement points in the semiconductor manufacturing process. However, the observed data contains not only useful information but also worthless and noisy information, and collecting all the information is not so good in terms of cost and time. Therefore, in this data analysis, we will select useful information (column information) in the semiconductor manufacturing process and estimate the cause of the problem in order to reduce the production cost.
